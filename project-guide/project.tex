\section*{Overview}

One key outcome of this course is for you to produce a piece of work you can use
to demonstrate your computational skills to potential employers. That work will
come in the form of a Jupyter notebook. As you know, these
notebooks allow you to combine code, text, and graphics in one user-friendly
document. We will add them to our GitHub repository (with your permission) so that you can use a link
to show others what you've done. You will also be able to see what your
classmates have done.

The relatively loose structure in self-directed projects like this makes them
more challenging than most things you do in school. We think that also makes
them more interesting. They give you a chance to indulge your curiosity and show
off your creativity.

We have divided the project into components to keep you on track. The intent is
to make the project easier by breaking it down into a number of small,
manageable sub-projects. The early steps are graded only on whether you do them:
you get full points if you do them, none if you don't. We start with individual
work.  Partway along, we encourage you to form groups of two or three, but if
you'd prefer to do this on your own, that's ok, too.


\section*{Project outline}

The components of the project are

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllrr}
\toprule
Assignment                  & Format  & Individual/Group &  Points & Due \\
\midrule
Three Project Ideas         & Paper (hand-written)  & Individual  & 0 & Nov 10 \\
Project Proposal            & Paper (professional)  & Group       & 5 & Dec 1 \\
Data Report                 & Paper (professional)  & Group       & 10 & Dec 8 \\
Final Project               & Jupyter notebook      & Group       & 85 & Dec 23\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

{\bf Dates are firm and not open for negotiation.}

Each part of the exam must be uploaded to Brightspace before the deadline.


The components consist of:
\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Three project ideas.}

Write down three project ideas. One or two sentences each is enough.
Use your imagination.  Be creative.  Speak to others. Write down things that
interest you. This will not be graded, but it will give you something to work
with later on.

Over the coming weeks, we recommend you keep your ears open for possible
{\bf project ideas} --- and {\bf data sources\/}.

\item{\bf Project proposal.}

Form a group of between one and three --- no more --- and choose a single
project from those you submitted --- or perhaps some other idea if you get a
sudden flash of inspiration. Flesh out the project in more detail, {\bf
including the data source\/} and two figures you plan to produce with it. Total
length should be no more than two pages.

On the off-chance you missed the point:  you should {\bf be clear about the data
you plan to use\/}. If you can't get the data, your whole project can be
derailed.

{\bf Did we mention data?}

\item {\bf Data report.}

Describe your data and how you accessed it in enough detail that someone else
could do it. Yes, that's ``accessed,'' past tense.  You should have done this
already to make sure you have it. Include your Python code.

Internet sources are preferred, because it allows others to use your code and
follow up on your work.

\item {\bf Final project.}

You should submit your {\bf notebook\/} to Brightspace by the due date listed
above. The submission should include any data or supplementary files needed to
execute your project. The final writeup should be a Jupyter notebook and the
file name should be your last names separated by dashes and a short title ---
something like {\tt Jones-Smith-Zhang.ipynb}.

Your project should include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Description cell.  Put a Markdown cell at the top of your notebook that
includes the title of your project, a list of authors, and a short summary of
what you do.  Think of the last one as an advertisement to potential readers.
\item Data.  Description of data sources and the code to read the data into
Python and reformat it as needed. This should be done in enough detail that
someone else can reproduce what you've done.
\item Graphics.  A series of figures that tell us something interesting. Three
or four would be enough, but do what you think works best for your project.
Think about the narrative:  What story do you want to tell?
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\section*{Free advice}

Some things to keep in mind:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Keep it simple.}

Most project ideas turn out to be too big.  You're generally well-advised to
carve out a manageable subset of what you think you can do. There's no reason to
worry about this at the idea generation stage, but as you develop your project
you may find that you need to focus more narrowly on a part of it.

\item {\bf Find data.}  Make sure you can get the data you need. One way to
assure this is to start with data and ask what you can do with it. Ideally you
want the intersection (picture a Venn diagram) of an interesting idea and good
data.  You can start with either one, but ideas are often easier to find than
data. Or start with an existing project that uses data you can access yourself
and extend it in some way.


\item {\bf Ask for help.}
We have years of experience with this kind of thing. If you're stuck, let us
know and we'll try to help. You can also post questions on the class discussion
board.

\end{itemize}


\section*{Grading}

Projects will be graded on their overall quality.  This includes, but is not
restricted to, these categories:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Quality of the idea.  Is the question clearly articulated?  Is it
interesting? Does it have general appeal?
\item Quality of the data.  Does the data support the idea? Is it the best data
for this question?
\item Degree of difficulty.  Some ideas are harder than others to implement. As
in Olympic diving, you get credit for taking on a challenge.
\item Professional look.  Does your project look professional?  Are the graphs
easy to understand?  Are they clearly labeled?
\item Demonstration of skills. Does your project showcase what you've learned in
this class? Do you use some of the theory or algorithms we've worked on? How
does your application of these tools impact your final writeup?
\end{itemize}
