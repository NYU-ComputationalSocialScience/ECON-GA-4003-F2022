    "    work with data) is to use information to assist decision making\n",
    "    processes\n",
    "-   This includes both performing analysis and communicating results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communicating results\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Being able to effectively communicate and share the output of our\n",
    "    work is essential\n",
